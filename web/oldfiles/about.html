            students the benefits of using appropriate study strategies. To

    	<!--p>Imagine an application that could take in any document, and return intelligent questions based on that very document. The goal of our project was to create this very application in order to help students learn. Our project, QuizMe, seeks to make studying easier and encourage active learning. Research has shown that students who test themselves on the material tend to have a better understanding, leading to higher test scores and higher final grades. However, therein the issue lies. The process of creating content-based testing questions related to, say, reading material can be an arduous task that acts as a barrier for even committed students. To that end, we are developing an application that utilizes several different natural language processing and machine learning techniques to dynamically generate knowledge-testing questions based on a given corpus of text. Our hope is that in reducing the burden and required “start up” effort on the student, even by a little, they will find it easier to engage in quizzing themselves and as a result improve their academic performance. In addition to this, QuizMe allows for researchers to further study the academic benefits of quizzing oneself, as well as how a tool such as this impacts a student’s motivation to study.</p-->
