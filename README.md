For instructions on how to get **QuizMe** running on your computer, please see the [Local Setup](https://github.com/quizme/QuizMe/wiki/Local-Setup) page on our Wiki.

**QuizMe** was created by a team of computer science seniors at the University of Colorado Boulder in the 2016-2017 academic year. We are sponsored by Adam Young, a PhD student in the Institute of Cognitive Science. The initial goal for this project was to find a way to encourage students to test themselves and benefit from the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect). Our team [decided to build a web app](https://github.com/quizme/QuizMe/wiki/Design-Decisions) that allows students to upload documents containing textual material they wish to learn, and quizzes them repeatedly with automatically-generated questions.

Our team (and their primary roles):
* Bu Sun Kim (backend, question generation)
* Mitch Lewis (frontend, appearance)
* Dylan Nguyen (backend, dev ops)
* Ryan Tabler (team lead, middleware)
* Cameron Tierney (backend, database)
* Spencer Wilson (frontend, quiz logic)
